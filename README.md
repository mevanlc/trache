# trache - cache your trash

`trache` (træʃ) is a fully compatible drop-in replacement for `rm` that sends things to Recycle Bin (Windows) or Trash (macOS/Linux/BSD).

## Motivation

* Because has `rm -W` ever worked for anyone? Probably not?
* The only advice the `rm` man-page gives you about data recovery is that "you might be able to recover the data after using `rm` on it, so consider using `shred` instead."

## Usage

Put it on your PATH and use it like `rm`. Or don't put it on your PATH and use it like `trash`. I'm not your life-coach, alright?
